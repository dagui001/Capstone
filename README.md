# Capstone
Hello World!

My name is Daniel Aguirre and this is my Capstone Project.

I've uploaded all the jupyter notebooks with my python code to run the algorithms covered in my report.

Additionally, you can find :
  - the revit model and dynamo file used to layout the smoke detectors.
  - R file used for testing the data
  - SQL file
  - associated csv and json files.
